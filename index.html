    <p>
        FreeCast is the world's first traffic forecasting system that uses innovative machine learning to combine traditional travel time prediction with weather forecast and live events.
        Not only is FreeCast capable of providing more accurate travel time prediction, its innovative approach allows it to maintain that accuracy in areas where weather and live events are likely to impact travel time.
    </p>

    <h2 id="background">BACKGROUND</h2>
    <p>
        Traditional travel time prediction relys on using previous records to set up a model. It works well for areas with traffic that fllows well-defined patterns (think Bay Area or LA County).
        However, in areas where traffic tends to be impacted by weather and other live but isolated events (constructions, protests and such), these traditional models tend to be very unreliable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Based on patent-pending technologies resulted from over five years of research, FreeCast's unique approach uses machine learning to combine hundreds of thousands of data points and create accurate travel time predictions up to 7 days in advance.

    <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Why did you guys build FreeCast?</strong>
            <br/>
            Among the regions we target, an average commuter spend more than <strong>a week</strong> stuck in traffic <strong>every year</strong>. This is bad for yourself, the environment and everyone else. Plus, sitting in traffic sucks!
            <br/>
            We believe by providing better, more accurate travel time prediction, we can not only help drivers get their destinations in time, we can also reduce traffic congestion.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Why not just use Google Maps?</strong>
            <br/>
            We can't comment on the inner-working of Google Maps' travel time prediction algorithms. However, comparing FreeCast's predictions with those of Google Maps is one of our key performance metrics. In the six months, FreeCast has constantly outperforms Google Maps for accuracy in the regions we support.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>FreeCast is not available in where I live!</strong>
            <br/>
            We chose Singapore and Taiwan to launch our private beta because these two countries have comprehensive tarvel time record, and severe weather and live events play significant roles in actual travel time.
            We use California because it is the contrary - traffic patterns are very well-defined in major cities in California. We want to make sure FreeCast performs equally well in these regions.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>I love what you guys are doing! How can I help?</strong>
            <br />
            Thanks! We are very passionate about FreeCast too! If you are in a region we support, please <a href="mailto:beta@freecast.online">join the private beta</a>. Otherwise, we love to <a href="info@freecast.online">hear from you</a>!

    <p>
        Founded in the summer of 2016, FreeCast traces its origin to a hackathon project by our founder, Rachel Liu. She started building the scratch model for time-prediction in 2013, and spent the next 3 years gathering data and fine-tuning the model using deep learning technologies.
        Joined by Janet Lee and Mike Huang, Rachel founded FreeCast Technologies to promote the commercial applications of FreeCast.
